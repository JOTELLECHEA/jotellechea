# Jonathan Tellechea
From the intricate dance of subatomic particles to the limitless possibilities of coding, I have always been captivated by the world of science and exploration. My journey through life has been marked by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a commitment to unraveling the mysteries of the universe. My academic background includes a Bachelor's degree in Physics from the prestigious University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). This degree has not only shaped my thinking but also laid the foundation for my future endeavors. I have leveraged my educational background to make a significant impact in the field of high-energy particle physics. My research focused on improving a cut-based analysis method for ttHH production at the HL-LHC, a complex and crucial aspect of particle physics. I achieved this by harnessing the power of machine learning through boosted decision trees, paving the way for more accurate and efficient analysis techniques.

Skills: Python / NumPy, Pandas, Uproot, Awkward Array, Hist, Coffeaâ€‘Casa
